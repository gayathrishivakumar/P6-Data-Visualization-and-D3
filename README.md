# Project-5-Data-Visualization-and-D3
This is the fifth and final project as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegee. Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or allows a reader to explore trends or patterns. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

Raw Dataset: [THE U.S. PROFESSIONAL SPORTS MARKET & FRANCHISE VALUE REPORT 2012](https://www.wrhambrecht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SportsMarketReport_2012.pdf)

**Steps Taken:**

1. Download PDF report.
2. Extract Tables from PDF using [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/). Takes about 10 Minutes to extract the two tables from the PDF report.
3. Use dplyr pipelines in r to create separate dataframes for each sports league. Combine together using rbind.
4. Use ggplot2 to visualize the two datasets and see that there are two different trends.
5. Create D3 Visualization.

**Tidy Datasets:**

Dataset 1: Annual Revenue of each major sports league in North America (Figure 14 - Page 22)

Dataset 2: Annual Attendence of each major sports league in North America (Figure 5 - Page 8)
