# Project-5-Data-Visualization-and-D3
This is the fifth and final project as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegee. Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or allows a reader to explore trends or patterns. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
