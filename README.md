# P6-Data-Visualization-and-D3

This is the sixth project as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegee. I created a data visualization from a data set that tells a story and allows a reader to explore trends or patterns. I used d3.js to create the visualization. My work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

####Original
The original dimple.js visualization I created before receiving feedback can be found [here](
